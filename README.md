# Paris-Route-Finder
A JavaFX app for finding routes between landmarks in Paris using graph algorithms. Features include DFS for multiple route options, shortest path with Dijkstra and BFS, and cultural/historic routes. Users can add waypoints, avoid landmarks, and visualize routes on a map. Includes JUnit tests and JMH benchmarking.

## Features
* Multiple Routes (DFS): Generate multiple route options using Depth-First Search (DFS).
* Shortest Route: Find the shortest route using Dijkstra's algorithm or Breadth-First Search (BFS).
* Cultural/Historic Routes: Discover routes with the most cultural or historical significance using Dijkstra's algorithm.
* Customizable Routes: Users can add waypoints or avoid specific landmarks in their routes.
* Visual Feedback: Routes are displayed graphically on a map of Paris.
